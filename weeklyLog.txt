Week 1
01/10/2019
Created my first prototype of the end effector of the robot using cardboard and some gears 
to demonstrate it's basic functionality
Have ordered electronic components online
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 2
13/10/2019
Configured DC motor to be controlled by a push button. Next thing to do is build a prototype
of robot gripper, to be controlled by the motor.
Also did a bit of configuring for the MPU-6050 accelerometer with the Teensy LC, whilst waiting for the
DC motors to arrive.
Getting the prototype of the gripper controlled by the motor is what I need to have done by the end of this month
to keep on schedule.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 3
20/10/2019
Built my first semi-functioning prototype and have it being controlled by a push button using previous circuit.
This prototype needs more work and could possibly start building another version soon.
I need to incorporate the L293D IC chip to be able to open and close the gripper (move the dc motor both directions) 
Will order this week

Week 4
24/10/2019
Implemented the L293D IC chip in hardware to act as a motor driver, allowing me to control the direction of the
motor. I was able to control the direction using two physical buttons, and also through software using PWM.
Next thing to do is to implement this on my prototype, so I can open and close the gripper with two buttons.

25/10/2019
Two push-buttons not working - tried to test them turning on an LED but they both seem to be damaged. Will need to
get some more next week. In the meantime, getting the flex sensors configured. Built a circuit where the flex 
sensor controls the brightness of an LED.

27/10/2019
Tested opening and closing my prototype 1.0 with two push-buttons. It works the moderately
well for the first couple tests, but then the output isn't as good. I noticed that my prototype is consuming a lot of
my 9V battery's power quite quickly, probably due to friction in the gears? Will need to keep in mind for next
prototype. 
Also configured a flex sensor and attached it to my glove. Works pretty well. Next thing to do is probably look at
making a better prototype that can display a better output than the current one.
